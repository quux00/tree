<h2>Tree</h2>

<p>This repository is a start towards implementating the Unix/Linux <code>tree</code> command in multiple programming languages.  You can learn more about the native tree command here: <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/unix/tree.htm">http://www.computerhope.com/unix/tree.htm</a></p>

<p>So far, I have created a very simple Ruby version and two Java versions - one that will work with Java 6 (and earlier) and one that will work only with Java 7, as it uses the new Java7 NIO2 <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html">Path</a> interface.</p>

<p>I initially did this project to have a version of tree on Windows with either Ruby or Java.</p>

<p>Over time, it would be a good exercise to do this in more languages - it is a good command to learn how files and directories are handled in a language.</p>

<h2>Java version</h2>

<p>You can build the Java 6 version with:</p>

<pre><code>ant compile6
</code></pre>

<p>You can build the Java 7 version with:</p>

<pre><code>ant compile7
</code></pre>

<p>Once done, run:</p>

<pre><code>ant jar
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a tree.jar file in the dist directory.</p>

<p>I have provided two simple shell scripts to run it - you'll need to install the jar somewhere and then modify the appropriate shell script.  If you do this with a .bat file on Windows, feel free to send it to me.</p>

<p>The real tree command supports quite a number of command line switches.  My Java version only supports a few so far:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./tree.sh -h
Usage: tree [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]
DIRECTORY is optional and defaults to current dir.
OPTIONS:
-a    : Show all files, including files starting with .
-d    : Show dirs only
-i    : No indentation
-h    : Show this help screen and exit.
</code></pre>

<h2>Ruby version</h2>

<p>The Ruby version depends on no gems, so you can just run it.  Currently, the only switch it supports is <code>-h</code> (or <code>--help</code>).</p>
